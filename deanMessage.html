                            <p>As the People’s Republic of China reaches an important milestone of its 70th anniversary, School of International Studies, Renmin
                                University of China, one of the oldest and top university-based faculty specialises in
                                international relations and political science in PRC, is proud of its long term intellectual
                                contribution to Chinese political development, foreign policy, and international cooperation. In the last 70years, reflecting the evolving
                                interaction between China and the rest of the world, we have expanded our teaching and
                                research from diplomacy and world socialism studies into Chinese politics, comparative
                                politics, political theory, international.security, strategic studies, international political economy, and a broad range of
                                regional studies. Generations of our graduates have devoted themselves to public and private sectors that drive the rise of China, academia and media that inform the public, and international organizations that bridge the globe. Besides working with our students on campus, our faculty members also transform their research into policy outputs, advice government agencies and shape public opinions. </p>
                            <p>The new era of world politics and China’s own development lead to both pressure and opportunities for SIS. Upgrading our academic disciplines, such as
                                international relations and political science, calls for more innovation. We have to address the limitations of individual disciplines with further integration of
                                international relations, political science, and other relevant disciplines within the framework of world politics studies. Due to China’s unprecedented engagement with the world, we have to broaden our vision from Western-centric focus to a truly global one. </p>
                            <p>We are prepared to deepen and broaden our international exchanges and
                                cooperation, and Renmin University’s unique association with contemporary China, and our first class research on Chinese politics and foreign policy ensure that we can facilitate understanding of China by outsiders. In teaching, we provide more
                                international exchange opportunities to our students, offer a wide range of degree programmes taught in Chinese and English to international students. Our
                                international engagement also goes beyond ivory tower to organise or participate in discussion with international practitioners of our subjects, including politicians,
                                diplomats, officers, and think thank analysts on shared interest.   </p>
                            <p>Based on our predecessors’ academic achievement, with the continued support of our faculty members, students, alumni, partners and colleagues at home and abroad, we will make long term efforts to push SIS RUC toward a world class school of international relations and political science, contribute more to the
                                discipline we focus on, provide more support to China’s own development, promote mutual understanding and confidence among different countries, as well as global governance, stability, and prosperity.</p>
